## Introduction

Hi! If you are reading this, it means you are reviewing my take home test for the Scytale somebytes takehome test. I appreciate the opportunity to show some finesse.

I have implemented the application as specified with Go. I decided to use the [Go
Cloud Development kit](https://gocloud.dev/) such that the code would be portable without any additional work between
AWS S3, GCP and Azure, in-memory and file-blacked blob storage. The facilities should readily support unit, integration, end-to-end testing.

## Installation

- go version go1.12.3

## Testing

### Unit

### Integration

### End to End
